no surnames given to the name an orphan actually anyway the name just the name-Orion..i suddenly looked at Dave he at me both had an uncanny feeling that something wasn't right about Hibiscumost afterall#..i somehow to quell him shown my system and told not to use it meaning don't search the meaning#..so#..i then myself searched as the battle was getting started just as i did i thought what am i doing Orion is such a common um..why would a name be Orion no matter how common may it be#..,anyway match by then starts out comes Magma much battle worn the surface is thus adjusted to pure volcano Dave is hesitating for some reason#..Magma evolves to utmost by then#..then Dave lets go of#..Entei#..The Fiorran Entei#..so#..ok i was a bit surprised then saw a much determined look in his face so smiled and concentrated on the match but by then it's Magmer max evolved#..Dave starts with much difficult attacks already..none defended..AT ALL#..count starts gets up at 9..Magmorter max evolve record it reads in board#..Dave smiles cause Entei itself was max evolved#..suddenly all notices the trainer was all along reading#..The Parameters of Conflict a Comics Centric Novel#..now i realised something was afoot absolutely#..none says anything some people have some weird methods#..anyway after this on a volcanoc surface#..Magmorter and Orion exchanges places after making a suitable place ref still doesn't say anything some people have weird..i stood up stop this drama ok whose that lowlife#..all dragged me down no matter their own suspicion#..now Dave have much determination something i rarely saw anyway i was concerned,Entei zooms up on Orion now we all hear in the &#128266;..<br>
