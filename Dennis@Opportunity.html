Dennis(laughing..) : "the biggest change that i saw was when we started this profession was so revered and all we got paid well etc people did many sports but these cups and all were biggest in sports were the biggest in research works and so on but as Jubilee Hands-On arose then eventually Doctor Slate and DaisyDevil and then finally upto Pallet Ridge came up that was the very last gen of any form of entertainment or profit driven research#..you can't entertain more or be so more than Simile Popcorn,neither can you make more profit nor can you have a more fulfilling relationship with nor can you have any essence bigger nor can you have a better recreation nor can you need or have recreation and so on in one sentence all opposites ceased as Reticence asked for Vat#..the rest of fuzziness were fed to Peril of look a reference to and in self as well- That..countering..so#..the real gear 6th started from then and it's said will continue only till they get out in one year all will be back exactly to where it was#..as there will be infinity to ponder and work with and so on but alas not Hands-On..countering boo lexicon#..so#..we did witness that stuff many ask us why combat sports alone stayed but became like what it was only shadows and takedowns rest only demos and commentaries by the very practicioner's own clans that's another cup#..it's impossible to do anything at all in the midst of opportunity as it's said only before or after something can be done..shuu..countering-Hands-On#..so now it's like whole day work all they talk about is these brats now they can't do anything else as that's out of question intuition's hologram#..so#..this whole is what Mr Andrew Asompor tried to put under an institution i have no idea what it meant neither did anyone else not even Mrs McShin#..she said we've thoroughly been played by them all along while they babysitted us to the utmost why bother hankering after definitions#..but DoDo NotSoSure said and only Mr Jim supported him now Ms Mollibuk absolutely none else conforms#..exactly they've been selected Mr Andrew did admit that definitions didn't work#..but in existence Mr Jim is the only person whose still after that elusion#..and Ms Mollibuk is unhappy because someone as pure souled as her you know no plurality and so on said these brats intentionally grasped me for fun#..so that's a lost case like Mr Otto and Humberto#..they just are too idealists even in gear 6 hence always preyed upon#..but Mr Jim still is after the institute of Opportunity#.. gear 6 idealism means it should be open to elasticity thus move up and down#..but Mr Jim still wants to hold these brats accountable for anything that happens#..so i recently went to see him as you know whole world wants that#..and he's absolutely incensed that the home he made he couldn't stay for 1 day#..he said my objection is that it went to host another Police station i wanted a charity#..so they sell Doctor Slate Shirts there obviously profit-felt#..Dawn..Dashing Crook,Brock too un..#,..man all the businesses went to bushes since that launching day i still remember,as all asked i conformed as if i didn't or i'm doing now it means i would be anchored to myself regardless of as or else..the Arcane is only thus self though as it is only felt..no not that but that.. it's that feeling..of wearing not something as that's only a validation to feeling..itself thus conjoined compeer anyway i went enough as determination finally is just that feeling..any demand for conclusions brushed aside as a feeling#..Dawn..Leading Rock,#,so#..that was the end of profit based business and the start of product based business they said these definitions came automatically just as we thought they're necessitated yeah#..DaisyDevil,#..so#..then actually it started as i said i went to ask this point to Mr Jim he said it all started from that cursed day when Randy Tantrum arrived we knew that was the end of all heavens#..Randy Tantrum was a hideous curse upon any gears#..and poor Terry became the centre of this revolution#..he still says those weeks i was with Humdrum Daxtie and Heartie even said we didn't do anything at all compared to what Terry was forced to do you know through Pallet Ridge to Pasio Siquetim Ridge um..bro where's this,..shuu..what Billy..what is#..Guzzle Humdrum,#..anyway#..but then Simile Popcorn's works are what is gear 6 actually Lastly Phantom and Wheel Running unleashed the 5th#..but since Conscious Precious arrived the end has already begun as they said cause that's the limit for any the-s#..so now all should be sad but they're too happy instead they said why this is what's life's all about a Simile of Sojourn#..Dawn..Reticence Vat,#..so yeah it's been an opportunity indeed#.."
