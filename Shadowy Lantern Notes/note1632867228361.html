Shining Seen,#,..and i always thought because of that i was dragged with this brat along too#..Serrie and Mitte weren't exactly normal we all knew#..The Chapters of Context,#,..Bazu and Avam were always agnostic to present they were only found afterwards where people reacted to their movements#..like once they were chased by thugs and police alike because they intruded a confrontation zone and stayed there cleaning the road hence both got distracted cause none really could aim at them#..and once they were given an ovation for volunteering in controlling some runaway animals from hitting a mentally challenged group of people who were sitting in a park but their caregivers themselves fled#..so they are put on stage where they said did you see those animals coming at you we only told them to share the challenge with the unemployed they so happily obliged you see told us we only wanted to ask why you're no more me..but we read that tgere must be a question as to any ambiguity projected we said no we can't see in spontaneously you see we have a vision to cessation conservation challenge#..The Paragraphs of Percepts and the Chapters of Context-&gt;The Eligible Surfaces,#,..so#..these when set out after 3 years of making non interpretable scenes all felt so relieved#..Sheenie was very calm and collected and detached from all else but given that dad worked as their driver and was alone to raise me this brat was shoved down my throat#..so i only was exposed to things dad wanted to shield me from but he went into abstraction when i was 10 so next 11 years i was forstered upon The Eligible Surfaces,#,..anyway they left i returned i had my badge so wanted to settle down rather see them 14 years later if not in next cosmology#..so next day Sheenie goes out i said good riddance#..Avam and gang and their involuntary gang had long been LEGALLY forsaken by their families#..now i was supposed to look after uncle and aunty who also adopted me but Sheenie leaves they told me to follow this brat#..so i thought ok a little walk around then i'll grab their properties#..so i go i had called up Warrie before as i said i was exposed to all the proper stuffs for my circumstances by these brats#..Warrie came from an even worse circumstances but now we understand how both managed to get the badges still no matter#..Abraham+Miette&amp;Bazugh+Serena..The Procured Ones,#,..atleast we talked with one other unlike only looking at never without as if challenging while patronising#..The Eligible Surfaces,#,..so#..then we follow Sheenie for 10 kms without her knowledge while enjoying our foods#..then we return feigned innocence#..then that week itself suddenly was going somewhere in my occupied car when a person wanted a lift i didn't stop it was a security concern but i saw in mirror that person like was so excited at it#..so i got a bit puzzled as if what if plan B i activated#..so i rushed through and reached home then i enter my room and was was telling Warrie about it he said be careful not excited more#..then within a month we were going according to our plans but our pokemons started misbehaving and many things though it only scared us we managed all the time then next month these intensified only then next month we had to give up our plans cause we were most renouned targets and victims we couldn't continue undercover#..after may be a year later we by then was legally bounded#..we met this person same place same time that i did now Warrie said stop the car it's broad daylight with Police cars around#..this person we came face to face seemed outrageously happy#..then asked us are you going to relief compeers i never found it apart from another you see but in the same way never found the vectors to me#..The Convectors of Solace,#,..then i spontaneously said do you know Sheenie i mean..,Obstruction#..<br>
