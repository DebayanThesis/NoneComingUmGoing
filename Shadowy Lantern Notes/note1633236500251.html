any reactions validated or questions answered..shh..it was provided..so encodin'#..Format Optics..shuu..countering,#,..,so#..we understood Viridian town itself exists due to us exactly why the local people call it Opt Town#..Modal Option,#,..exactly how hands-on though just to be countering#..Jubilee Hands-On,#,..then i was returning actually inside the gate what happens isn't subject to necessity#..The Doorbells of Redundancy,#,..so#..then i'm asked do you live compeer do you live alongside or as,i said as,Limitation#..,i said but if alongside then i can't live hence i said,just to be the least perceptive#..,i said if i live as then also i must be perceptive of as-ness,just to be the most committed..shh..so much truthfulness to accordings,i said i don't like you as you're conscious yet intruding my rationale as if it's to you the most generic#..Living Hunter,#,..,when i found this compeer alas i was or proven as any..shh..so refill oriented..anything hidden from commitment,..it seems you're upto deceiving illusion that's not happening,countering..any concerns unfulfilled,i said i'm moving to Marengo#..,you may go to Goldenblaze afterwards compeer do you know what is involuntary#..,i said necessity,the most arriving indeed..inference never present at beginning..shh..just to be the most.. Apprehendin',i said i'm leaving thanks I don't like this tone to end with#..Living Hunter,#,..then actually Marengo would've cost more cause i hade to go through flight so chose to visit Goldenblaze in train#..,alight.. therefore..todays chore..the least stable the most novel#..The Backlog Bits,#,..so#..anyway i was told to go there so i just landed in station and was going to take a flight only from here Yellowburst none goes to#..Name's Behalf,#,..so#..i landed when i see a person who was getting into the train,so i went backwards a bit so that this person could get in with the luggage but i was spat at,you found me as an obstacle to need not a lens of vivid..admit this#..Baby Dawn Groundon,#,..so#..i was very angry and&nbsp; said and you call yourself civilized#..The Inferred Ones,#,..then#..the person by then had come up and i was viciously slapped,you knew how to understand civility despite it being a reflection of fairness admit this ok#..Baby Dawn Groundon,#,..then i went aside in much anger#..,this person goes straight to my seat and occupies my things#..The Inferred Ones,#,..so#..i was like so incensed so went there to confront to which this person was so wondered said oh you have memories too not just judgement i didn't know but i admit that..UNLIKE YOU#..Baby Dawn Groundon,#,..,so now i wondered why none else said anything there so i asked are you a ghost#..,but that's upto your validation take that you brat..and yeah admit that you're aware of this being detached from your decision#..Baby Dawn Groundon,#,..,then i understood that this is a hallucination only#..The Inferred Ones,#,..then i go down much time was wasted so just alighted the platform when someone rode my back and blindfolded me and the train by then shut it's door i thrw this person off when was mobbed for violence and the train as if to mock me left when the previous person poked tongue at me#..The Inferred Ones,#,..,then i was like so angry but then i see who now have dragged me in this severe mess was the same person but now told all giggling,this is my you see any insertion necessary#..Baby Dawn Groundon,#,..,now i realized what happened is that these are involuntary as in situation the boomerang of perception just if as alas so convergin-G i finished my contemplation then realized this is called afterthought of completion#..The Inferred Ones,#,.."<br>
Dawn(laughing..) : "but i didn't share the same qualia only situations where Mango was a Robber#..The Inferred Ones,#,..so i managed to flee but none of my things survived but i had the money and was going to attend Yellowburst where i worked#..Daily Hologram,#,.. exactly how it coincides#..then i alight Yellowburst which no train arrived at mid-day from 14-15#..Daily Hologram,#,..so#..i reached at 16#..alight it's a police and convicts colony barring a few workers#..so i get down,Roto Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom..Change the Form or Cessation/else oh being abother is seer's hollow..oh that's patience's Popcorn#..Daily Popcorn,#,..so#..i thought may be after all i can escape the station enquiries due to not having taken any luggage with me the Simile of Behalf#..Reticence Demure,#,..then#..i alight check out but i had no luggage but had the money so took a shared cab cause that went quicker to my destination but it was incidentally shared by a group of thugs#..,then many years later after many difficult experiences both me and Mango met at Marengo again#..when we both recognized each other and vilified each other too so we couldn't really stay as singular people there either#..then before leaving we went to Pertinent Places where we were told it's just a concern#..Refill Concern,#,..,so we said but it's like inexistent for any advanced seeker# were told that thus it's an opportunity to refill this cessation on behalf of attention albeit countering as you see#..Simile Hologram,#,..then we understood why illusion should never be proven as attached to one#..Proven Umpteen,#,.."<br>
Susana(laughing..) : "but infact i was born as i realized something else#..which was I was born..in the fever/of oh what teethered/thus i was gone to be ever/found as not for my savour#..Simile Popcorn,#,..so#..whena i got the scholarship atleast i was happy unlike all else cause it was to Viridian Town#..and yes the scholarship is special too cause Yellowbust is the only justice and offence only city#..Daily Behalf,#,..each has a distinction this is the most notorious among them#..Am Where,#,..exactly#..at least one from family comes either a convict and normal worker or a justice associate and a normal worker or both#..very few come from outside in place to fill the gaps cause both interchange..daily#..Critical Similes,#,..we when grew up found Goldenblaze and Ivocarry so strange albeit countering#..Oceanic Counts,#,..so#..i get the scholarship this is Viridian town scholarship because for some reason it still runs all the labs at Silvercloud#..The Professional Ego,#,..the Sanctuary is open ended anyway even for the instigators as part of Shopping Lessons#..that is Hoping Function.. countering#..Shopping Lessons,#,..so i left home the scholarship read a beggar's right till the longest route to Frucifern..next term Phantom#..The Adjective of Adverb,#,..this runs only in Silvercloud it was geographically and philosophically detached from the rest of the world if not cosmology#..Refill Concern,#,..so i set out i was a well to do kid this was when i was 21+#..so get out in the road ok begging rights mean i vomited everything for first two days next day couldn't walk and yes you walk through the city not the relative village sides where wanderers are treated with some compassion at least#..and yeah Yellowbust main City i lived near Goldenblaze border#..so cross through the whole city start from home if any hindrance none of your own next term Random#..Phantom : The Meaning of Lie,#,..so#..i fell unconscious out of severe exhaustion on third day and only moved 15 kms#..the longest and shortest route to cross a city at Silvercloud barring Frucifern takes 100 exact days at 20 km per day..Upto Concur# because you must travel the whole city if you live at nearest border to the longest route you're required to go parallel to the city at longest distance which makes up the deficit..Unto Murmur#..Frucifern's extra 5 and 5 Days distance horizontal and parallel is because of Viridian Town which is exactly square at each side#..and the longest distance is started Frucifern itself from midway exactly if you took the earliest route you of course required to finish it..Guzzle Humdrum#..so i could only reach Cerulean end after 1200 days#..then 100 days crossing each city on land takes 5 days at sea 10# then from Cerulean i could reach Navyglide 2400 days later without crossing days#..then 5 days then my Journey ended at Goldenblaze-Yellowburst border after 1200 days later after Pasio#..in between you got a glimpse of Viridian Town if you decide to opt out till then Effort look Desire now Discerned#..Novelty agnostic Apocalypse,#,..so#..total journey is 4870 days 13 years a month and still 3 more days#..if healthy#..Oceanic Existing,#,..after which the scholarship reads you can afford an bycycle quality rendered#..Peril Fender,#,..this means security proof#..Fuzzily Candour,#,..the available images of that cycle says from one repairing shop to another#..if you don't cycle of course you walk back#..no money given the cycle is next to useless rest then real#..Firey Next,#,..so all saved the money to have at least one good meal no more afforded#..could only be having that meal only at Police Station who obviously throughout mark you..Devout Ration#..Connect Destination,#,..shuu..Jolly On-Roam#..Vagabonds of Usage,#,..exactly why#..this was to cross the given city only thankfully as it was to avoid bias against Frucifern#..so that takes say 105 more days so total for me it would've taken atleast 4975 days to report at Virid Town,Frucifern..Hands-On#..Jubilee Hands-On,#,..so#..that all and only means i may not need it at all albeit countering#..Jubilee Hands-On,#,..so#..then it takes 13 years 4 months and 15 days given my age 21 and 9 at start i'll be 35,1,15 by the end#..many people never reach though but they find it wasn't needed either hands-on#..those who reach are sent back to home if left still#..or given a home at anywhere on Police discretion#..so anyway i got going and on third day was out cold#..then i was woken up although this word is banned in preference to helping or making to return to physical awareness in Kanto#..Meaning Fender,#,..so#..i was woken up i see this person i fainted on a side at a roadwalk so i woke up and this person gave me something to eat it was very delicious so i just about took that food than said thanks Sir,double failure Susan albeit emotionally#..Penny Man,#,..so i said um..do you know me,and you won a scholarship i objected then you know Sandie failed to pass the mental test not emotional was trying to understand the pros and cons to any experience#..The A-Psychic Ones,#,..i said um..sorry but i still can't#..look at that person no there with the #.. why is he following you has been nabbed too many times infact many did follow you many forms many aims..uuu..so emancipating it must've been preceded spontaneity i must concede to self the idea though in reality it's just another chance's help#..The Psychic Cycles,#,..i tried to get up in haste i said it's Javi,Javier my boyfriend we..,Scintillating#..you must be familiar to that that person then#..Tge Psychic Cycles,#,..i now scowled and went off hearing, exciting#.. suspect suspect oh rationale inspection knocks on/fried fried seed of to do so dried leftover duality cue#..The A-Psychic Ones,#,..so anyway i went to Javi as fast as i could the Police was patiently waiting#..but i was too feeble so all saw this scnene so eagerly#..then we met Javi was crying like nothing but so weren't many others#..anyway before he talks a person akin to my form was sitting beside him who shook her head seeing us together finally and said this is why next can't he real unless rested indeed in fire..in self the most it was also you too read preceded#..The Rational Sells,#,..so i asked Javi whose this,i don't know i was following you similarly this person woke me up,i said hang on did she talk about someone,yeah Penny she said passed the mental test of unreckoning situations but failed the test of continuity of mentation by eagerly monitoring reactions not there common usage of heuristic-conviction conservation#..The A-Psychic Ones,#,..so i frowned and asked her do you know that person over there#..that form yeah#..Tge Rational Sells,#,..i angrily said that's your boyfriend i guess,yeah i recognise my form but can't say so out of relativity your question's implication#..The Rational Sells,#,..Javi asked have you won any scholarship by this and this, that's not to win but to give we were told#..The Rational Sells,#,..,then the Police broke it up for the sake of Sanity#..then Penny and Sandie meets..just before crossing over to different directions both poke their tongues at each other without any reasoning desire or emotion or thiught just as if yeah or more appropriately we reclled Oh yeah without the Spur#..Fuh Spur,#,..and then those two so nonchalantly moved to opposite directions#..The A-Psychic Ones,#,..so for some reasons me and Javi was so irritated by them we ran to follow them in opposing forms#..then we reached Frucifern in the way directed but that like was the aftermath of end of existence#..Simile Popcorn,#,..exactly as we felt#..when we woke up from an unmindfulness just after we received our badges as trainers..that feeling we understood not to<br>
 be gambled as one but spun as once#..Dashin' Rock,#,.."</p>
