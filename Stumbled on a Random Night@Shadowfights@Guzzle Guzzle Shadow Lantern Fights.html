Baiza(singing) : "Stumbled on a Random Night/Darkness oh Discerned Seer or Seeing's Strife/Oh Shadow of Two Fight/A Failed Attempt Means Seeing Twice..
Oh Stumbled on a Random Night/Darkness Now Seeing Strike/Focus Thus Scene Siphon Fight/Oh Look Failed thus Seer Seeing Strike..
Shaodw Shadow Lantern Where/Am Am Oh Eh Blur Or Swear/Really Dual One Persistent Two/Conflict means excrete to you..
Oh Stumbled on a Random Night/Perceiver sees or what then strike/oh escape to leftover spiked/by attention oh critique two stike
Ei Random Stumbled on a Random Night/Humdrum Humdrum Meaning Strike/Closure or One as end likes/Oh thus Guzzle Guzzle Shadow Lantern Fights..
