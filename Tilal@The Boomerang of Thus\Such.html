Tilal(laughing..) : "well i got my starter it was Meltan#..and got it from Pewter#..,so ok i get a Meltan i'm told..
To train i feel the need of mine/felt by who or will see thine/seer or self too focus peeking/behind oh see battle of me and treeking..
oh thus observe never sure/attachment then will not be pure/or formula of intrinsic gaming/between two oh trier who is aiming..
hence oh elusive this legend/teaming up on expect's patience/is happening or elusive being/oh seer hear or seer of now hailing..
Oh Kalos Kalos if wise/self no apart from guise/thus oh Meltan now obscured feeling/observer elusive reality's yelling..
so i read it out then somehow managed to be separated from Melmetals#..The Boomerang of Thus/Such,#,..
