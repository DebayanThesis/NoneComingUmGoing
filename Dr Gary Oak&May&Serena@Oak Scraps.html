May(laughing..) : "man mom and dad said our families and all friends etc are absolutely inconsolable that both our little dolls have been grasped by of all Look-only-At..then i went out to be a pokemon trainer became lexicon whatever..my ðŸŒ¹ was all along incensed with them all and only because they lacked proper interpersonal skill education..anyway then we're told day one it's a Peer-to-Peer organization meaning if you depend on anyone next thought Phantom..hence only the severe conscious tortures administrated conscious torture is another that i had to undergo to understand..but nothing like Serrie though a brat like that firstly is in-self discontented..secondly was thoroughly infatuated with look-only-at..and to the worse took Mehu flower as final authority..Mehu flower i met first time one moment seemed too seraphic next moment if the previous is deliscerned obviously had to be Phantom as trained.."
Serena(laughing..) : "well the earliest memory i have was that i was hungry next moment angry next moment afraid next moment if i knew then it wouldn't have been a matter of percept..anyway,so i'm 1.25 as per semester rules,Seth is 2.75 first time mom and dad came here and i saw him and felt like he should be babysitting me immediately so viciously jumped him..then he fondled me like nothing but this is total 3 days so on 4th i woke up and found myself at a very strange place with someone looking down on me whose whole disposition resembled an exact 2.75 year old just in some terms..so anyway then this also to me felt like this is just the opposite part of Seth so i jumped her too..anyway then eventually i wasn't allowed to stay at Oak Labs and mom and dad cut all ties with them the same day Fortune Haps arrived..now they say if only we knew what sort of intricately cunning pros both were..but then the same day because i was irritating them enough took me to this recreation centre for ballet i was 2#..so i go and meet this brat Mittie who on first sight said,you brat why are you looking like me i answer this is how you be then..then both created a mayhem it was revealed she was blindly infatuated with Discuss Gap..then both uncle and aunty and my parents they left us alone thus never lone..so then we didn't complain much barring the fact that Bazu and Abham were a semester older who always irritated and teased us accordingly in Mittie's order reverse to mine#..and Sheenie we met the same day she was a sem younger so we fondled her too much but we realized she's too wise for relativity..then eventually this was when we were 4.25 and Sheenie 3.75 from then on our systems started#..so eventually we all got registered as labours below 6.5 Sheenie wasn't even 5#..then the day all were expatriated to Blurpink-Ranblue cross HQ that was the most outrageous place and name too to be at#..then we saw 4 brats there who all were pre-selected thus kicked out#..these were namely Mr Sataut and Halmsley,Mr and Mrs Eritak and none of them were at all sane by the standards of official workers not normal#..then we were tasked to reach out to the order was the needs and necessaries of futility..so we then those who came later like us had to work hands-on albeit at the back at post intention as they said..this is cause we were in practice ourselves so if couldn't succeed next thought random..and we did these till 7.25 accordingly now when i'm 7.25 day one i go out to work by then i had no friend,family,relation or security only involution and redeemability#..means we're going to be hosted by any given Police Station as Dr Oak was stationed at the only property that is a single room with a single toilet at Rimtom point at Frucifern-Flexdijon cross point#..none can stay there anyway as part of sectional region so this hut was built toilet means just an enclosure the room is big enough only for 2 persons to stay together that was only Dr and Mrs Oak none else could enter cause it required professionalism in personal terms#..there all the information came  with extremely sophisticated instruments none requiring more than a communicator and an authenticator#..rest were the responsibility of Police and border semi-military as directed by Strawberry Codes#..the payback was that those who stayed there in that region said it was most comfortable intellectually cause Dr Oak being in arms reach means it's just Mr Oak Mr Oak#..so it was cosmic fun they said#..then Lillie flower only came around once a month for 3 exat days when Dr Oak left to meet the Committee head#..and it must be said Mrs McShin ofcourse declined so Mr Bistorter then Mr Jidokakal Senior for a brief till they had to budge to TerryBilly#..then DoDo NotSoSure the longest and the most horrendous run all newborn knew him and called by this name for all of 19.5 years#..then it was Jidokakal Jr. for 14 these are in myths now what and how they ruoed these brats#..and now finally HolyParachute whose the sweetest of all in terms of idealism to previous ones so they're going to babysit her to the absolute limitless especially with Conscious Precious and so on#..and she's already 70 now so they said 5 years means billenia double of what Wolfgang grandpa faced exactly as part of Upto Concur#..anyway these were what i had to say about my views due to the ongoing surveillance#..anyway this was the only property registered to anyone of us at that time till these individual ones and the messes for only ones where we've all been forced in after Unova Unloaded-Pasio Necessitated#..the rest of what we did after training is Hands-On as is what we did before as information is no matter scarcity or abundance,agnostic to self sufficient security..countering#..
